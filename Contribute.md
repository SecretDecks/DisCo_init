   - <...>
   - <...>
   - <...>
  
- activity in our GitHub repositories is tracked as well

# How we vote

- Any core member can create a poll
- Before a poll can be created in Discord it has to manually receive two peer approvals. A github issue has to be raised], which gives a short summary of the poll and requests a peer review. A template for the voting report can be found [HERE](<create template and put link here>)
- If the vote result has a large impact a proposal will need to be written beforehand and the voting timeframe has to be <7 days> minimum.
- If the vote result has a small impact a poll can be created with a minimum timeframe of <48 hours>.
- Poll answers & results need to be documented in the issue raised beforehand and be approved by <two> peers.
- Any change management needs to reference the issue in GitHub when creating additional items like discussions or other issues.

* You can close fixed bugs by testing old tickets to see if they are still happening.
* You can update our changelog here: <**TBD**>
* You can remove duplicate bug reports by:closing them as duplicates

# Beta testing

This section explains if your project needs beta testing. Explain why early releases require heavy testing and how they can help with specially across browsers and on different hardware.
